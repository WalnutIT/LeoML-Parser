# LeoML Parser

LeoML parser is a software package that provides interface for client applications to work with
LeoML documents. It checks for proper format and validate the LeoML documents.

## Problem description and objectives

### Problem description

Web applications or mobile apps often have long structured texts, such as blog posts or articles.

In this case, it very often makes sense to deliver them to the client only when needed and not right
at the beginning.

Furthermore, such texts are often very complex. They consist of headlines, paragraphs, images,
quotes and much more. To make matters a bit more difficult, each author also has their own stylistic
devices to make a text visual (for example, to highlight certain passages).

HTML or Markdown are well-known markup languages that address this issue. However, both have the
following disadvantage: they do not use the full power of Flutter.
With [flutter_html](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_html) you can certainly do a lot to adapt a
long structured text to the author's wishes. However, it is not Flutter and it is not a widget that
is used to give the text its appearance. It's HTML and CSS.

The same is true for the [flutter_markdown](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_markdown) package.

Both packages do not offer the limitless possibilities to visually style a text the way Flutter
does.

### Objectives

The goal is to design a markup language that structures text in a way that it can be easily read by
both humans and machines. This markup language shall be named 'LeoML'.

The individual components of a LeoML document are to be assigned to individually designed widgets by
means of a LeoML parser. This should ensure that every text gets an individual appearance and that
all possibilities of Flutter can be used.

## LeoML

LeoML is a machine-readable markup language for outlining and formatting text and other data, which is
using the JSON format for structuring the content. LeoML is using templates in order to structure
the text.

Version 1.0.0 of LeoML knows two types of templates:

1. Blog
2. Article

If you don't know how LeoML is structured, you can find the detailed documentation of LeoML [here](https://github.com/WalnutIT/LeoML-Parser/blob/master/leo_ml_documenation/LEOML.md).

## Features

- Define individual widgets or use default widgets for each object.
- Parsing a LeoML document to a column of widgets.
- Parsing a LeoML document to a set of widgets.

## Usage

### How to create a blog post using the blog template

Hint: Default widgets will be used, if a object is mentioned in the LeoML document and no
corresponding widget was injected.

#### Create a blog instance without custom widget builder injection

```dart

final blog = Blog();
```

#### Create a blog instance with custom widget builder injection

```dart

final headlineBuilder = MyHeadlineBuilder();
final openingBuilder = MyOpeningBuilder();
final subHeadlineBuilder = MySubHeadlineBuilder();
final sectionBuilder = MySectionBuilder();

final blogTemplate = Blog(
  headlineBuilder: headlineBuilder,
  openingBuilder: openingBuilder,
  subHeadlineBuilder: subHeadlineBuilder,
  sectionBuilder: sectionBuilder,);
```

#### Instantiate the LeoML parser

```dart

final leoMLDocumentParser = LeoMLDocumentParser();

```

#### Parse the leoML Document

```dart

const leoMLDocument = '[...]';

// first option: parse the LeoML document to a Column, which includes the widgets
final column = leoMLDocumentParser.parseToColumn(leoMLDocument: leoMLDocument, template: blogTemplate,);

// second option: parse the LeoML document to a Set<Widget>
final set = leoMLDocumentParser.parseToSet(leoMLDocument: leoMLDocument, template: blogTemplate,);
```

#### Complete example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:leoml_parser/leoml_parser.dart';

Column column = const Column();

Future<void> main() async {
  final blogTemplate = Blog(
    headlineBuilder: MyCustomHeadlineBuilder(),
  );
  final leoMLDocumentParser = LeoMLDocumentParser();
  column = await leoMLDocumentParser.parseToColumn(
    leoMLDocument: leoMLDocument,
    template: blogTemplate,
  );

  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'LeoML Parser example',
      home: const LeoMLParserExampleApp(),
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
    );
  }
}

class LeoMLParserExampleApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const LeoMLParserExampleApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Center(
        child: SingleChildScrollView(
          child: Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 12.0),
            child: column,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MyCustomHeadlineBuilder extends LeoMLWidgetBuilder {
  @override
  Widget build({required Map object}) => MyCustomHeadline(object: object);
}

class MyCustomHeadline extends StatelessWidgetTemplate {
  const MyCustomHeadline({super.key, required super.object});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => Text(
    object['headline'],
    style: const TextStyle(
      color: Colors.green,
      fontSize: 44.0,
      fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
    ),
  );

  @override
  void validateObject() {
    if (object['headline'] is! String) {
      throw AtomicObjectIsNotStringException(
        subTagName: 'headline',
      );
    }
