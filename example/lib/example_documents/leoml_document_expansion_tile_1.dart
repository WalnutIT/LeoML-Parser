"},{"paragraphHeadline":"Note 1"},{"paragraph":" ‘May be connected to an active device’ - such a connection is deemed to exist between a non-active device and an active device where the non-active device forms a link in the transfer of the substance between the patient and the active device and the safety and performance of one of the devices is influenced by the other device. For instance, this applies to tubing in an extracorporeal circulation system which is downstream from a blood pump and in the same blood flow circuit, but not directly connected to the pump.
